## 📖 Summary
---

Anyone can land a rocket, right? Is a simple game, made in unity, about balance and trying to land a rocket. It was inspired by the hot topic news (of the time) about Elon Musk's
SpaceX reusable rockets that could land after having carried a payload to space. It was an attempt to both adhere to the theme of the jam (balance) and to make a humorous homage
to their rocket landings.
