Anyone can land a rocket, right? Is a simple 2D arcade game, made in unity, about managing fuel, collecting power-ups, and trying to (safely) land a rocket. It was inspired by
the hot topic news (of the time) about Elon Musk's SpaceX reusable rockets that could land after having carried a payload to space. It was an attempt to both adhere to the theme
of the jam (_balance_) and to make a humorous homage to their rocket landings, and built entirely in _Unity_.

## 🛠️ Implementation details

This game was made from scratch in Unity in under 8 hours using C#, and contains several features:

- Minimap – Accurate representation of where the rocket actually is at all times.
- Power-ups – Different abilities that affect gameplay in new ways.
- Obstacles – Birds that will need to be avoided to make it safely to the ground.

Press A and D to rotate the rocket around its own axis, and SPACE to trigger the booster applying forward acceleration. Try not to hit the birds on your way down!
